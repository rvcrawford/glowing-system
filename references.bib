	abstract = {Achieving global goals for sustainable nutrition, health, and wellbeing will depend on delivering enhanced diets to humankind. This will require instantaneous access to information on food-source quality at key points of agri-food systems. Although laboratory analysis and benchtop NIR spectrometers are regularly used to quantify grain quality, these do not suit all end users, for example, stakeholders in decentralized agri-food chains that are typical in emerging economies. Therefore, we explored benchtop and portable NIR instruments, and the methods that might aid these particular end uses. For this purpose, we generated NIR spectra for 328 grain samples from multiple cereals (finger millet, foxtail millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum) with a standard benchtop NIR spectrometer (DS2500, FOSS) and a novel portable NIR-based instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone). We explored classical deterministic methods (via winISI, FOSS), novel machine learning (ML)-driven methods (via Hone Create, Hone), and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for building the calibrations to predict grain protein out of the NIR spectra. All of the tested methods enabled us to build relevant calibrations out of both types of spectra (i.e., R $^{\textrm{2}}$ ≥ 0.90, RMSE ≤ 0.91, RPD ≥ 3.08). Generally, the calibration methods integrating the ML techniques tended to enhance the prediction capacity of the model. We also documented that the prediction of grain protein content based on the NIR spectra generated using the novel portable instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone) was highly relevant for quantitative protein predictions (R $^{\textrm{2}}$ = 0.91, RMSE = 0.97, RPD = 3.48). Thus, the presented findings lay the foundations for the expanded use of NIR spectroscopy in agricultural research, development, and trade.},

Whole, ground and defatted ground soybean were scanned by a diode array NIR analyzer and defatted ground soybean were scanned by a Fourier transformed NIR analyzer. Samples were analyzed for crude protein and amino acid contents using reference wet chemistry methods. The NIR calibration models of crude protein and most amino acids showed acceptable coefficient of determinations (R2c = 0.605–0.952), while the NIR models for Cys, Met and Trp were less accurate (R2c = 0.498–0.667 for Cys and R2c = 0.482–0.615 for Met and R2c = 0.406–0.481 for Trp). The R2c values in NIR calibration were found to relate to the correlation between amino acids and crude protein. The grinding process and lipid extraction were found to improve the NIR spectroscopy in crude protein and amino acids prediction. The Fourier transformed NIR analyzer was found to perform similar to the diode array NIR analyzer for defatted ground soybean analysis. No significant differences were found between crude protein and amino acid contents predicted by these two NIR spectroscopy instruments (P {\textgreater} 0.05).},

	abstract = {Aim of the study was to predict quality parameters namely protein and carbohydrate content of wheat grain stored for one year at 4 °C and 21 °C using Near Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Chemometrics. The spectra of grains were measured in reflectance mode using lab made filter based pre dispersive NIRS ranging from wavelength 750 nm to 2580 nm. NIR Wavelengths were divided into two sets for all the stored samples depending on its correlation with factors. The reference data and NIR data were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) scores, partial last squared regression (PLSR) model, Multiple Regression Analysis (MLR) and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR). First four factors were sufficient to develop regression models for the above mentioned methods. Prediction performance was compared on the basis of the coefficient of correlation (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the calibration and validation sets. R2 values for prediction of protein content from PLSR model were 0.955, 0.997 for 4 °C Wavelength Set I and II and 0.903, 0.989 for 21 °C Wavelength Set I and II. For the prediction of carbohydrate content 0.978, 0.951 and 0.946, 0.974 were the R2 values for the 4 °C and 21 °C wheat samples Set I and Set II respectively. MLR model also gave R2 values greater than 0.9 for all the samples. Wavelengths with high β correlation coefficients were defined. SVMR predicted the protein content and carbohydrate content with good accuracy. SVMR and PLS results. All the models developed showed good accuracy for successful prediction of protein and carbohydrate content of stored wheat grains with PLSR and SVMR giving the best results. This study showed that near infrared spectroscopy has potential to distinguish wheat grains stored under different conditions.},

	abstract = {A study was made of the relative accuracy of three near infrared reflectance (NIR) instruments: a monochromator and two lower cost scanning filter instruments. All instruments used in this test were manufactured by Pacific Scientific, Silver Spring, MD. The monochromator was the 6100 with a scanning range of 1100 to 2498 nm. The 51A had a scanning range from 1596 to 1756 nm and 1988 to 2356 nm. The 102 scanned from 1902 to 2320 nm. Computer programs developed for the National NIR Forage Project were used to conduct the instrument comparisons tests. Agricultural products used in the experiment were hay, haylage, corn (Zea mays L.) silage and corn grain. Analyses included crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), Ca, P, K, M, and dry matter (DM). The 6100 generally had lower standard errors of validation than the scanning filter instruments. Although the six-filter 51A had more spectral information than the three-filter 102, it did not consistently out-perform the 102. There was no trend for one math treatment or series of wavelengths to be selected across instruments, products, or analyses. Regardless of the instrument spectral capabilities, the fraction of explained variance (R2) values for CP, ADF, and DM were higher than the R2s for the minerals. Even though the accuracy of the filter instruments was often below that of the scanning monochromator, the differences were small and would be of little significance for many agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A near‐infrared (NIR) spectroscopy method was developed for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of protein content of intact sorghum grains. Effect of grain sample moisture variation on the robustness of protein calibration was investigated. FINDINGS: An initial NIR protein calibration model with sorghum grains in 7.28\%–11.57\% moisture content range with coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.94 and standard error of cross‐validation (SECV) of 0.41\%, predicted protein content of an external validation set of different varieties with R² = 0.90, root‐mean‐square error of prediction (RMSEP) = 0.42\% and bias = −0.02\%. However, when grains with a wider range of moisture content (7.50\%–17.75\%) were used for validation, prediction errors increased with R² = 0.72 RMSEP = 0.87\% and bias = −0.32\%. Inclusion of grains with a wider moisture range to the calibration set improved the performance of the calibration model with a R² = 0.83, RMSEP = 0.67\% with a bias of −0.04\%. CONCLUSIONS: Variation of moisture content in grains affected the performance of the NIR protein calibration model. Likewise, inclusion of moisture variation in the calibration sample set improved the robustness of the model. SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: In addition to the traits of interest, variation of other physical or chemical traits should also be considered for inclusion into the calibration sample set to improve the robustness of NIR calibration models. This is especially important when NIR spectroscopy methods are developed for evaluation of breeding populations as the future grain samples from numerous crosses may be substantially diverse.},

	abstract = {For many decades, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to determine the composition of animal feedstuffs and grains. More recently, mid-infrared spectroscopy (mid-IR) has also been examined for similar determinations. These spectroscopic methods offer the potential for rapid and accurate determination of organic constituents, such as fiber components and protein, of forages, by-products, and grains at reduced cost and greatly increased speed (minutes instead of hours or days). Because they are nonchemical in nature, they result in a large reduction (90\% or more) in the chemical wastes associated with standard chemical-based assay methods. The same components of interest for biofuel production (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, starch, protein, oil, etc.) are those that have already been determined by NIRS/mid-IR for evaluating grains and animal feedstuffs. Therefore, these techniques would appear to be a natural match for evaluating feedstocks for biofuels, and the literature shows that efforts in this direction are being successfully tested and instituted. For this discussion, an overview of where such efforts are and the potential for NIRS/mid-IR in producing biofuels will be covered. For example, while there are similarities between the needs of the biofuels industry and the analysis of animal feedstuffs, there are also both practical and technical differences between the two that will likely impact how NIRS/mid-IR is developed for biofuels. As an example, grain analysis for protein is performed on a large scale by government agencies such as the Canadian Grain Commission and U.S. Grain Inspection Service, while at least in the United States, animal feedstuff analysis is performed by state or independent laboratories for individual farmers. For biofuels, this might well result in most analysis being performed by the large corporations converting the feedstocks to biofuels, as opposed to the individual producer having analysis performed at an independent laboratory. Similarly for animal feedstuffs, measurements of fiber (neutral detergent fiber or NDF, acid detergent fiber or ADF, and lignin) and protein are carried out. These fiber measurements often consist of more than one type of fiber component with some being computed by difference (hemicellulose = NDF – ADF) and are empirical at best. Whether such empirical estimates will be sufficient for assessing biofuels or whether new spectroscopic methods for directly measuring the components of interest (cellulose, etc.) will need to be developed is a question to be answered when components other than starch for ethanol or oil for biodiesel become common.},

However, different software packages tend to use different variants, which lead to a translation problem if more than one package is used. Here the relationships between squared Mahalanobis distance D2, the GH distance of WinISI, and the T2 and leverage (L) statistics of The Unscrambler are established as D2?=?T2 ≈ L???n ≈ GH???k, where n and k are the numbers of samples and variables, respectively, in the set of spectral data used to establish the distance measure. The implications for setting thresholds for outlier detection are discussed. On the way to this result the principal component scores from WinISI and The Unscrambler are compared. Both packages scale the scores for a component to have variances proportional to the contribution of that component to total variance, but the WinISI scores, unlike those from The Unscrambler, do not have mean zero.},
