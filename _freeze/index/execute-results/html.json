Hemp may consist of types grown for grain, fiber, or dual purpose types.\n\nProtein is important because of its nutrition\n\nNear-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology is rapid, non-destructive, and cheap. Within the context of plant breeding, a sample of undamaged grain may subsequently be planted. NIRS technology has been used since the 1970's to assess oil seeds [@reeves_potential_2012, @williams_application_1975]\n\nHere\n\nFor this study, a benchtop NIR spectrometer was used to develop a model to predict crude protein content based on a data set representing multiple years, locations, and cultivars.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nbckgrnd <- read_rds(\"./input_data/sample_background/simplified_background/background_data_set.Rds\") |> setDT()\n\n bckgrnd[,in_ny:= ifelse(loc!=\"kentucky\", T, F)]\n \nbg2 <- bckgrnd[loc!=\"kentucky\"]\n \ntab <-  table(bckgrnd$in_ny)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Hemp Grain Sample Background\n\nSpectral data were obtained from whole (unground) hemp grain samples, harvested at maturity, collected from 2017 - 2021 from 18 cultivar trials in New York (NY) (149 samples). Grain samples were obtained by hand sampling or mechanical harvest and were cleaned of chaff and dried at 30 C for six days in a forced-air dryer. In total, at least 40 cultivars were represented in the data set. Cultivars were grain or dual-purpose types.\n\nAll NY cultivar trials were planted in randomized complete block design with each cultivar replicated four times. The 2017 data were comprised of samples from the same thirteen cultivars sampled from six NY locations. For those trials, grain was harvested from each plot individually and aggregated by cultivar. Four subsamples were drawn from each aggregated sample and scanned separately. All remaining samples from 2018 - 2021 were collected on a per-plot basis. All cultivars and possible locations were represented in 2017, but only a selected subset of cultivars and locations were represented in 2018-2021.\n\n### Spectral Data Collection and Preprocessing\n\nA FOSS/ NIR FOSS/NIR Systems model 5000 instrument was used to obtain the spectra (FOSS North America, Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Spectra were collected every 2 nm from 1100-2498 nm. For 2017, spectra were collected from each subsample; these spectra were averaged at each 2 nm increment. WINISI software version 1.02A (Infrasoft International, Port Matilda, PA, USA) was used to average the spectra in 2017, as well as to select samples for crude protein laboratory assay from 2018-2021. Samples were selected for assay according to their spectral distance from their nearest neighbor within the calibration data set with a cutoff of a distance of 0.6 H, where H is approximately equal to the squared Mahalanobis distance divided by the number of principal components used in the calculation [@garrido-varo2019]. For selection, spectra were preprocessed using SNV-detrend with settings 1,4,4,1 for the derivative, gap, smooth, and smooth 2 settings respectively. \n\n### Software used:\n\nAdditional analysis was performed\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nMultiplicative scatter correction (MSC)\n\nstandard normal variate (SNV) transformation\n\nThe calibration set consisted of\n\nThe validation set consisted of\n\nLaboratory assays were performed by Dairy One Forage Laboratory (Ithaca, NY). For those assays, 1mm ground samples were analyzed by combustion using a CN628 or CN928 Carbon/Nitrogen Determinator.\n\nPrior to In 2017, an in\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n## SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL\n\n## OPTIONAL SECTIONS\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n## FIGURES AND TABLES\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\neruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)\nn_eruptions <- length(eruptions)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#cell-fig-timeline .cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npar(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)\nplot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), \n  pch = \"|\", axes = FALSE)\naxis(1)\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma](index_files/figure-html/fig-timeline-1.png){#fig-timeline fig-alt='An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\navg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))\navg_years_between_eruptions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout .hidden}\n\n```\n[1] 79.83333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every 79.8 years on average.\n\nStudies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).\n\nEight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).\n\nData and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.\n\nLet $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                | Year |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Current             | 2021 |\n| Teneguía            | 1971 |\n| Nambroque           | 1949 |\n| El Charco           | 1712 |\n| Volcán San Antonio  | 1677 |\n| Volcán San Martin   | 1646 |\n| Tajuya near El Paso | 1585 |\n| Montaña Quemada     | 1492 |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\n\n![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}\n\nLa Palma is one of the west most islands in the Volcanic Archipelago of the Canary Islands (@fig-map).\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/explore-earthquakes.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
