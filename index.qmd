## INTRODUCTION

Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an annual crop with potential uses as a source of food or feed from grain, and bast fiber or hurd from the stalk. Hemp cultivars are commonly grown for one or both purposes and a cultivar may be referred to as a grain, fiber, or dual-purpose type. Because of protein's nutritional importance, the protein content of a grain crop is an prime consideration for researchers, producers, and consumers. Whole hemp grain typically contains approximately 25-30% protein [@ely_industrial_2022; @barta_proteomic_2024]. Crude protein (CP) is often used as a proxy for the direct measurement of protein concentration and consists of the multiplication of nitrogen concentration by a conversion factor because measuring nitrogen concentration is relatively easy and cheap via laboratory assay [@hayes_measuring_2020].

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology is rapid, non-destructive, and cheap, and consists of the measurement of NIR radiation reflected from a sample [@roberts_near-infrared_2004]. NIR spectra from many samples are related to laboratory values for components such as moisture, protein, fat, or fiber \[@roberts_near-infrared_2004\]. NIRS technology has been used since the 1970's to assess forage CP [@reeves_potential_2012; @williams_application_1975]. A NIRS calibration set often consists of samples from one species grown in many environments encompassing the range of expected values from the analyte or analytes [@chadalavada_nir_2022]. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is a typical method used in the agricultural and food sciences to relate spectra to analyte [@roberts_near-infrared_2004].

A NIRS-scanned sample of undamaged grain may subsequently be grown, an important consideration for a plant breeder. In wheat and corn, grain protein content has been shown to be heritable \[@giancaspro_genetic_2019; @geyer_genetics_2022\]. This suggests (at least potentially) that NIRS technology could serve as resource to more rapidly identify high CP hemp germplasm, senabling the delivery of higher CP hemp grain cultivars faster.

For this study, a benchtop NIR spectrometer was used to develop a model to predict CP content based on a data set representing multiple years, locations, and cultivars using PLSR.

### Hemp Grain Sample Background

Spectral data were obtained from whole (unground) hemp grain samples, harvested at maturity, collected from 2017 - 2021 from `r nrow(distinct(bckgrnd |> filter(loc!= "kentucky"), harv_year, loc))` cultivar trials in New York (NY) (`r tab[2]` samples). Grain samples were obtained by hand sampling or mechanical harvest and were cleaned of chaff and dried at 30 C for six days in a forced-air dryer. In total, `r bg2$cultivar |> unique() |> length()` cultivars were represented in the data set. Cultivars were grain or dual-purpose types and included both commercially available and experimental material.

All cultivar trials were planted in randomized complete block design with each cultivar replicated four times. The 2017 data were comprised of samples from the same thirteen cultivars sampled from six NY locations. For those trials, grain was harvested from each plot individually and aggregated by cultivar within each trial. Four subsamples were drawn from each aggregated sample and scanned separately. These spectra were averaged at each 2 nm increment. All remaining samples from 2018-2021 were collected on a per-plot basis. All possible cultivars and possible locations were represented in 2017, but only a selected subset of cultivars and locations were represented in 2018-2021.

### Spectral Data Collection and Preprocessing

A benchtop NIR spectrometer (FOSS/ NIR FOSS/ NIR Systems model 5000) was used to obtain the spectra (FOSS North America, Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Spectra were collected every 2 nm from 1100-2498 nm and the logarithm of reciprocal reflectance was recorded.

WINISI software version 1.02A (Infrasoft International, Port Matilda, PA, USA) was used to average the spectra in 2017, as well as to select samples for laboratory assay. Samples were selected according to their spectral distance from their nearest neighbor within the calibration data set with a cutoff of a distance of 0.6 H, where H is approximately equal to the squared Mahalanobis distance divided by the number of principal components used in the calculation [@garrido-varo_note_2019]. Prior to selection selection, spectra were preprocessed using SNV-detrend with settings 1,4,4,1 for the derivative, gap, smooth, and smooth 2 settings respectively.

### Additional software used:

Additional analyses were performed using R Statistical Software [@r_core_team_r_2024]. Data were tabulated and summarized using the tidyverse and data.table \[@barrett_datatable_2024; @wickham_welcome_2019\]. PLSR models were constructed using the pls package and validated using caret \[@kuhn_building_2008; @liland_pls_2023\].

### Laboratory Validation

Laboratory assays were performed by Dairy One Forage Laboratory (Ithaca, NY). For those assays, 1mm ground samples were analyzed by combustion using a CN628 or CN928 Carbon/Nitrogen Determinator. Samples from 2017 were aggregated as described above, but

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every `r round(avg_years_between_eruptions, 1)` years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
