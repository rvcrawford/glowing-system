\subsection{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}

Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an annual crop with potential uses as a
source of food or feed from grain, and bast fiber or hurd from the
stalk. Hemp cultivars are commonly grown for one or both purposes and a
cultivar may be referred to as a grain, fiber, or dual-purpose type.
Because of protein's nutritional importance, the protein content of a
grain crop is an prime consideration for researchers, producers, and
consumers. Whole hemp grain typically contains approximately 20-30\%
protein (BÃ¡rta et al., 2024; Callaway, 2004; Ely \& Fike, 2022). Crude
protein (CP) is often used as a proxy for the direct measurement of
protein concentration and consists of the multiplication of nitrogen
concentration by a conversion factor because measuring nitrogen
concentration is relatively simple (Hayes, 2020).

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology is rapid, non-destructive,
and cheap. It consists of the measurement of NIR radiation reflected and
absorbed from a sample (the spectra) and the relation of the spectra to
laboratory values for components such as moisture, protein, fat, or
fiber (Roberts et al., 2004). NIRS technology has been used since the
1970's to assess forage CP (Reeves, 2012; Williams, 1975). A NIRS
calibration set often consists of samples from one species grown in many
environments encompassing the range of expected values from the analyte
or analytes (Chadalavada et al., 2022). Partial least squares regression
(PLSR) is a typical method used in the agricultural and food sciences to
relate spectra to analyte (Roberts et al., 2004). PLSR calculates
components that maximize covariance between predictor and response
variables. PLSR uses some number of components, often selected via
cross-validation, in order to fit the regression model and is commonly
used in spectroscopy because it tends to work well with
highly-correlated, noisy spectral data (Wold et al., 2001).

A NIRS-scanned sample of undamaged grain may used for other purposes
besides its scan or it may planted as a seed. In wheat and corn, grain
protein content has been shown to be heritable (Geyer et al., 2022;
Giancaspro et al., 2019). This suggests (at least potentially) that NIRS
technology could serve as resource to rapidly identify high CP hemp
germplasm, enabling the screening of more germplam as grain, before
planting to the field, and thus enabling the more efficient development
of high CP hemp grain cultivars.

For this study, a benchtop NIR spectrometer was used to develop a model
to predict CP content based on a data set of hemp grain representing
multiple years, locations, and cultivars from grain and dual-purpose
hemp types using PLSR.

\subsubsection{Hemp Grain Sample
Background}\label{hemp-grain-sample-background}

Spectral data were obtained from whole (unground) hemp grain samples,
harvested at maturity, collected from 2017 - 2021 from 18 cultivar
trials in New York (NY) (NA samples). Grain samples were obtained by
hand sampling or mechanical harvest and were cleaned of chaff and dried
at 30 C for six days in a forced-air dryer. In total, 38 cultivars were
represented in the data set. Cultivars were grain or dual-purpose types
and included both commercially available and experimental material.

All cultivar trials were planted in randomized complete block design
with each cultivar replicated four times. The 2017 data were comprised
of samples from the same thirteen cultivars sampled from six NY
locations. For those trials, grain was harvested from each plot
individually and aggregated by cultivar within each trial. Four
subsamples were drawn from each aggregated sample and scanned
separately. These spectra were averaged at each 2 nm increment. All
remaining samples from 2018-2021 were collected on a per-plot basis. All
possible cultivars and possible locations were represented in 2017, but
only a selected subset of cultivars and locations were represented in
2018-2021.

\subsubsection{Spectral Data Collection and
Preprocessing}\label{spectral-data-collection-and-preprocessing}

A benchtop NIR spectrometer (FOSS/ NIR FOSS/ NIR Systems model 5000) was
used to obtain the spectra (FOSS North America, Eden Prairie, MN, USA).
Spectra were collected every 2 nm from 1100-2498 nm and the logarithm of
reciprocal reflectance was recorded. A 1/4 rectangular sample cup (5.7
cm Ã 4.6 cm) was used.

WINISI software version 1.02A (Infrasoft International, Port Matilda,
PA, USA) was used to average the spectra in 2017, as well as to select
samples for laboratory assay. Samples were selected according to their
spectral distance from their nearest neighbor within the calibration
data set with a cutoff of a distance of 0.6 H, where H is approximately
equal to the squared Mahalanobis distance divided by the number of
principal components used in the calculation (Garrido-Varo et al.,
2019). Prior to selection selection, spectra were preprocessed using
SNV-detrend with settings 1,4,4,1 for the derivative, gap, smooth, and
smooth 2 settings respectively.

\subsubsection{Laboratory Validation}\label{laboratory-validation}

Laboratory assays were performed by Dairy One Forage Laboratory (Ithaca,
NY). For those assays, 1mm ground samples were analyzed by combustion
using a CN628 or CN928 Carbon/Nitrogen Determinator. Samples from 2017
were aggregated as described above, but the remaining samples were not
aggregated.

\subsubsection{Model Development}\label{model-development}

Calibration and validations sets were created by dividing the laboratory
CP values into tertiles according to their percent CP in order to ensure
that the range of CP values was present in both calibration and testing
sets. Within each tertile, 75\% of the samples were randomly assigned to
the calibration set and the remaining 25\% were assigned to the testing
set. For each calibration set, models were developed in the caret
package using PLSR. In fitting the model, the number of components was
optimized over a grid search from 1-20. Model performance was evaluated
with 25 iterations of bootstrapping and minimized root mean squared
error (RMSE) in selecting the number of components in the final model .

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://rvcrawford.github.io/glowing-system/index.qmd.html}{Article
Notebook}}

Initially a number of common spectral preprocessing methods were tested
by creating 100 calibration and testing sets, as described above.
Spectral data from those data sets were transformed by each of the
following methods: 1) first derivative, 2) Savitzky-Golay (SG) using the
first derivative, third order polynomial, and a window of size 5, 3)
gap-segment derivative using the first derivative, a gap of eleven, and
a segment size of 5, 4) standard normal variate (SNV), 5) standard
normal variate following Savitzky-Golay (SNV-SG) (same SG parameters as
above), 6) SNV-detrend with second order polynomial, and 7)
multiplicative scatter correction. For comparison, models were also
developed using untransformed spectra.

For each of these preprocessing methods, models were fit and predictions
were made on the corresponding validation set (since there were 8
preprocessing methods, 8 separate models were fit for each of the 100
sets. The relationship between the predicted and actual values of the
testing set were calculated via RMSE, R\textsuperscript{2} and Ratio of
Performance to InterQuartile distance (RPIQ), three common model
assessment metrics. Larger R\textsuperscript{2} and RPIQ, and smaller
RMSE values are superior. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed
for each of these metrics in order to compare the preprocessing methods.
For each ANOVA, each data set was considered as a subject and different
variances were allowed for each preprocessing method.

Once the most promising preprocessing method was identified, 1000 more
data sets were created and analyzed via that method and performance on
the testing sets was summarized with RMSE, R\textsuperscript{2}, and
RPIQ. The pattern of errors, expressed as the difference between the
actual and predicted values for a given sample, was examined.

\subsubsection{Additional software used}\label{additional-software-used}

We used R version 4.3.3 (R Core Team, 2024) and the following R
packages: caret v. 6.0.94 (Kuhn \& Max, 2008), data.table v. 1.15.2

\subsection{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}\label{results-and-discussion}

\subsubsection{Laboratory assay CP
values}\label{laboratory-assay-cp-values}

Laboratory assay percent CP values are summarized in the following
table. These are similar to the range of CP values observed in the
literature, indicating an reasonable basis for a chemometric model. The
CP values are left-skewed and two thirds of the samples contained more
than 25\% CP.

All preprocessing methods outperformed untransformed spectral data
Table~\ref{tbl-preproc}. Averaged together, all preprocessed spectra
were superior to untransformed spectra, with lower RMSE, and higher
R\textsuperscript{2} and RPIQ values (significant at \(\alpha\) level
\textless0.001). Preprocessing methods had -11.6 \% lower RMSE, and had
3.1\% higher R\textsuperscript{2} 7.4\% higher RPIQ than unprocessed
spectra. Preprocessed spectra also had lower standard errors than
untransformed spectra.

The SNV-SG method had the lowest RMSE, highest R\textsuperscript{2}, and
highest RPIQ averaging over all iterations. SNV-SG RMSE averaged 1.4\%
lower, while R\textsuperscript{2} and RPIQ averaged 0.4\% and 2.4\%
higher respectively than the next best preprocessing method (SG in both
cases), but the difference between the best and second best method by
metric were only statistically significant at \(\alpha\) \textless0.05
for RPIQ. RPIQ was devised to accurately reflect the spread of data in
skewed populations (Bellon-Maurel et al., 2010) and thus offers a robust
metric for model assessment where data may be skewed. Therefore the
superiority of SNV-SG as measured via RPIQ made it the best choice for
the final model.

These results are not surprising. SNV and SNV-detrend both correct light
scatter, which is often a function of differences in particle size and
sample packing density, although SNV-detrend is often used for
densely-packed, powdered samples (Barnes et al., 1989). SG is a
smoothing filter that regresses on the signal over a series of windows,
removing noise while preserving the signal's shape and features (Li et
al., 2020; Luo et al., 2005). Derivatives, here including SG,
gap-segment, and first derivatives pretreatments may remove additive and
multiplicative effects, but not necessarily light scatter; as well, the
derivatives can increase spectral noise if employed incorrectly (Rinnan
et al., 2009). Here, hemp grain was neither powdered nor densely packed
but samples were subject to light scatter and noise due to differences
in particle size in the grain.

The preprocessing methods examined represent a portion of those
available. As well, these methods tend to have a number of
user-adjustable parameters whose various permutations were not tested.
This subset of preprocessing methods and parameters nonetheless
contained substantial variations in model quality, demonstrating the
importance selecting an appropriate preprocessing method.

\subsubsection{Final model development and
summary}\label{final-model-development-and-summary}

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://rvcrawford.github.io/glowing-system/index.qmd.html}{Article
Notebook}}

The model improved most rapidly as the number of components increased
from 1 to 7, with the inclusion of each additional component being
associated with a decrease in RMSE of 5-12\% . From 8 to 12 componentss,
model performance continued to improve, although gains were more modest
(decrease in RMSE of 0.7-3\%). With 13 or more components, performance
gains were minimal and the relative ranks of the models tended to be
stable Figure~\ref{fig-model-calibration}.

Final model performance was similar, but not identical to, that obtained
during the initial comparison of preprocessing methods. The final
models' mean RMSE was 1.03, R\textsuperscript{2} was 0.83, and RPIQ was
3.89 (all calculated on the test sets). Despite the generally good model
performance, a subset of poor models can be seen. For example,
Figure~\ref{fig-final-metric-boxplot} shows twenty-one models with
R\textsuperscript{2} below 0.7. \textbf{more comment on poor models?}

To assess the patterns of errors within the models, a linear model was
fit considering the mean estimated error for each sample considering all
models where that sample was in the test set when compared to the
sample's actual value. The models overestimated \%CP by approximately
0.5 \% in the lowest tertile and underestimated \%CP by -0.01 \% and
-0.41 \% in the middle and highest tertile, respectively

This study is limited in that it represents the creation of one model
based upon spectra collected from one machine. NIRS calibrations can be
unique to a particular machine, even if the machines compared are of the
same model (Reeves, 2012). As well, the calibration and validation sets
are relatively small.

This research showed the promise of the use of NIRS in order to make
predictions concerning \%CP in hemp grain using PLS. Promising
preprocessing methods were identified and a model was validated. Further
research could refine a CP model by including more samples, identifying
promising spectral regions, or by examining other predictive methods.

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen
every 79.8 years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as
(\textbf{marrero2019?}), have proposed that there are two main magma
reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km
depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir
(10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s
(Figure~\ref{fig-timeline}).

Data and methods are discussed in Section~\ref{sec-data-methods}.

Let \(x\) denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, \(x\) can be
modeled by a Poisson distribution

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-poisson}{
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
}\end{equation}

where \(\lambda\) is the rate of eruptions per year. Using
Equation~\ref{eq-poisson}, the probability of an eruption in the next
\(t\) years can be calculated.
